                application.

            <remarks>
                These connect requests have been validated by the user (via
                account.healthvault.com) and the user has selected a record to share. Only the
                application which called CreateConnectRequest or its provisioning application will
                be able to access these connect requests.
                Validated connect requests are only available for retrieval for 90 days. HealthVault
                will delete the validated connect requests after that period of time. It is advised 
                that applications call GetAuthorizedConnectRequests daily or weekly to ensure that 
                all validated connect requests are retrieved.
