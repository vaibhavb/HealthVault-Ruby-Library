            </summary>
            <remarks>
                The GetThings method request is sent as a series of filter groups. Filter groups allow the
                caller to group otherwise separate GetThings requests into one. The response to this method
                request will also come in the form of response groups that correspond to each filter group. A
                filter group is uniquely identified by a name. 
                The results returned in each group can be composed of full things as well as partial 
                things. Full things will be returned up to a maximum that is configured on the server.

                            When a type gets versioned, HealthVault will retrieve instances of 
                            multiple versions even when only one type is specified in the request
                            filter.  By default HealthVault will map the XML of the instance to
                            the version supported by the application based on the base 
                            authorization XML specified in the configuration of the application in
                            HealthVault. However, if multiple versions are supported by the 
                            application, it can use this parameter to state the version format to
                            use when writing out the instance XML.
                            
                            For example, when querying for medications, HealthVault will retrieve
                            medications of both version one and two schemas. If an application
                            only supports version one of the medication schema, then HealthVault
                            will automatically map version two instances down to the version one
                            schema. However, if the application supports both version one and two
                            by declaring both type IDs in the applications configuration, then
                            version one instances will be returned using the version one schema, and
                            version two instances will be returned using the version two schema.
                            If this application wants to retrieve all instances using a common 
                            schema (say version two), then is would specify the version two type
                            ID in this parameter and all instances will be mapped to version two
                            of the medication schema before being returned.
