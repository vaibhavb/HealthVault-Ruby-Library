                Creates a connect request which will allow the user to tie their HealthVault 
                account to the calling application once the user validates the connect request.
            </summary>

            <remarks>
                The connect requests are validated when the HealthVault user correctly supplies the
                identity code and is able to successfully answer the challenge question
                (via account.healthvault.com). Validated connect requests will be delivered once
                the corresponding external application calls GetAuthorizedConnectRequests.
                Validated connect requests are removed by HealthVault after 90 days. It is advised 
                that applications call GetAuthorizedConnectRequests daily or weekly to ensure that 
                all validated connect requests are retrieved.

                                example, a mother of 2 children may want to name her connect 
                                requests after each child so she can distinguish one child's
